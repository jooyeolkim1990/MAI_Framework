# MAI_Framework

**Meta-Axiomatic Intersection (MAI)** is a conceptual framework for aligning semantic representations across LLMs.  
It introduces a multi-stage process of **Axiom → Intersection → Contraction → F\*** to formalize semantic convergence in multi-agent systems.

## 📘 Overview

- 🔹 Formalizes semantic drift and alignment between large models
- 🔹 Enables theory-grounded metric space for alignment benchmarking
- 🔹 Applicable to both interpretability and multi-model cooperation
